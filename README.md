# Verify Card Sample

VerifyCard consists of two services: Zero Auth and Consulta BIN.
Zero Auth is a service that identifies whether a card is valid or not, through an operation similar to an authorization, but with a value of $ 0.00.  
Consulta BIN is a service available to Cielo 3.0 customers that returns BIN features such as brand and card type from BIN (first 6 digits of card).  
Both services can be consumed simultaneously through VerifyCard.
